# Games List App Example

This is a Jazz demo app using Vue and Nuxt. All it does is allows you to create a list of games with name and description. However, in so doing it demonstrates a great many features in Jazz:

- Passkey authentication
- Passphrase authentication
- Jazz schemas
- Loading an using Jazz data
- Versioning of app data, with the ability to restore old data
- Sharing app data with other users

In other words, it is a working example of the foundation for building any Jazz app. 


Look at the [Nuxt documentation](https://nuxt.com/docs/getting-started/introduction) and [Jazz documentation](https://jazz.tools/) to learn more.
