# `jazz-vue-vamp`

Unofficial Vue bindings for Jazz (see [jazz.tools](https://jazz.tools)), a framework for distributed state.

## Vamp?
Vamp is a chord progression in Jazz that extends a song's duration. The whole point of this package is to extend Jazz.Tools into the Vue ecosystem, so it seemed like a good name. And we can't just call it `jazz-vue`, because that namespace was used back when Jazz was maintaining their own Vue package.
